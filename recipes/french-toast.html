            <p>This fabulous French toast recipe works with many types of bread â€” white,
                whole wheat, brioche, cinnamon-raisin, Italian, or French! Delicious served hot 
                with butter and maple syrup. The best breads for French toast are brioche, sourdough, 
                French bread, or challah. These varieties are dense and sturdy enough to handle total 
                saturation in the wet, milky, egg custard without falling apart. However, French toast 
                is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better 
                than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste - it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly 
                stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll 
                work just fine.in a pinch, any thick-sliced white bread will do. French toast is
